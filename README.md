# 👹 mattematte
A C++ ToolKit for matting, segmentation, SR and colorization with **MNN, ONNXRuntime** and **Vulkan**. The C++ code of mattematte is heavily based on **[lite.ai.toolkit](https://github.com/DefTruth/lite.ai.toolkit)** and it aims to provide a optimized version with **Vulkan** to accelerate the pre or post processes of matting, segmentation, SR and colorization.

## Codes Releases
The developing of mattematte is ongoing and will not be release soon ~ But, the basic version without Vulkan support can be found at [lite.ai.toolkit](https://github.com/DefTruth/lite.ai.toolkit).
